                <div class="aboutUsText">Cyber Volunteers is an organisation based in Brighton, UK, dedicated to helping
                    connect charities with
                    passionate, skilled and motivated volunteers. We work with our charities to provide them with volunteers
                    that meet their needs and help them grow, enabling them to do more of their amazing work. We also strive
                    to bring our volunteers valuable experiences, enabling them to spend more time making a difference and
                    providing them with unique and fulfilling opportunities. Above all else our main work is connecting
                    people with purpose.</div>
